Do you context switch much? Do you have many things you need to keep track of? Do you love procrastinating? Do you
enjoy [rabbit holes](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12778836)?

Well this will allow you to keep on procrastinating. Todo will allow you manage things you need to do without actually
doing them.

There is one additional benefit. You will be able to let go of that pesky thought that tries to remember something. You
will know that it is kept safe in a file somewhere. Thus freeing up space in the membrane for something else.

## Showcase

## Getting started

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

.bash_profile

```
alias todo="java -jar /path/to/todo/todo-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar"
source ~/.bash_profile
```
