Do you context switch much?
Do you have many things you need to keep track of?
Do you love procrastinating?

Well this will allow you to keep on procrastinating.
Todo will allow you manage things you need to do without actually doing them.

There is one additional benefit.
You will be able to let go of that pesky thought that tries to remember something.
You will know that it is kept safe in a file somewhere.
Thus freeing up space in the membrane for something else.
